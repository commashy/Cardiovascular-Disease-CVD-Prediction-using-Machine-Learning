This repository contains our research project where we employed machine learning techniques to predict the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). It encompasses the entire process, from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis, to model selection, evaluation, and optimization.

This repository contains our research project where we employed machine learning techniques to predict the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). It encompasses the entire process, from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis, to model selection, evaluation, and optimization.

The project used a dataset of 70,000 samples from Kaggle, which was further refined to 62,502 samples. Several risk factors for CVD, including blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking habits, and physical activity, were analyzed. We performed statistical tests like Pearson’s correlation, Chi-squared test, and Cramer’s V test to identify significant correlations with CVD development.

We then experimented with various machine learning algorithms, and selected the CatBoost Classifier for its superior performance and interpretability. Through hyperparameter optimization and extensive model training, our final model achieved an accuracy of 0.7315, precision of 0.7432, recall of 0.6835, and an F1-score of 0.7121.

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for those interested in leveraging machine learning for medical diagnostics and preventative healthcare. Explore our code, findings, and methodologies, and feel free to contribute or suggest improvements.
